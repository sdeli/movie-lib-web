        It has postgres database where the data - from the above mentioned website - lives and gets served, furthermore a nestjs backend and
        Angular frontend.

      <li class="list-item">
        Some technologies I was using on the back and the front: typeorm, typeorm crud, nestjs crud request, rxjs, ngrx, lodash, material ui
        components etc..

        When creating this, I was in kind of a hurry, so some things of course could have been done better, for example I have used 'px' as
        main unit, but I know in some cases I should have used 'rem', and at some points code may could be cleaner, but for now I think it
        should be fine.
      </li>
      <li>For writing the html and css, I have used some BEM notation where it made sense.</li>
      <li class="list-item">Finally please enjoy the application, <strong>I am looking forward to hear about you:)</strong></li>
