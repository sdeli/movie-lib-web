        <strong>There was no ribbon provided to highlight which games are new...</strong> The good news is, that it is a peace of cake to
        apply:)
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        Furthermore the image - I needed to recreate - has shown in the navbar such categories which can not be found in any of the
        categories assigned to any games (comming from this
        <a href="http://stage.whgstage.com/front-end-test/games.php">endpoint</a>)....
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">Due to this reason <strong>if you click 'live' or 'table' you will find an empty list.</strong></li>
      <li>
        The images I get from the above mentioned endpoint, have a shorter height then on this
        <a href="http://stage.whgstage.com/front-end-test/design.png">image</a>. That's why the layout can not be exactly the same.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        Furthermore I was using tslint as a main linter, which is maybe a tiny bit deprecated and I should may have used eslint, but it has
        done the job for now.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        I didn't use the colors which were provided in the task description, instead I have picked them with color picker... normally I use
        them, now it was easy and fast.
      </li>
      <li class="list-item">
        I have used 'px' as main unit, but I know I should have used 'rem'... it has crossed my mind at the end.. sorry.
      </li>
      <li>For writing the html and css, I have used some BEM notation.</li>
      <li class="list-item">Finally please enjoy the application, <strong>I am looking forward to hear about you:)</strong></li>
